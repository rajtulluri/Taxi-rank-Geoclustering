# Taxi-rank-Geoclustering

Taxi ranks are hubs where the Taxi's are usually waiting for customers or parked after hours. A Taxi rank can be seen in major hotspots such as Airports, Railway Stations, Bus Stations, Downtown of a city etc. The goal of this project is to use efficient clustering to find optimal number and locations of service centers for Taxi ranks in the city of Johannesburg.
The dataset contains latitude and longitude locations of every Taxi rank in the city. The notebook contains a step by step procedure of applying clustering techniques to realize the goal.
